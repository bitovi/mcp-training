# MCP Training Material Guide

## Project Overview

This project (https://github.com/bitovi/mcp-training) creates step-by-step training materials for building MCP (Model Context Protocol) services using Node.js and TypeScript. The training follows a practical approach from basic stdio servers to production HTTP services with OAuth 2.1.

The steps for the training can be found in `<project-root>/training/*`.

This project also includes:

- The final output of all the steps in `<project-root>/final/*`
- Initial scaffolding of the project in `<project-root>/*`.

## Training Authoring Workflow

**For Content Authors**: This training is authored using the following workflow:

1. **Root folder development**: The project root (`<project-root>/`) contains the current working version where we develop and test each step's final result
2. **Reference implementations**: Each `training/{step}/` folder contains reference files showing the starting point and final state for that step
3. **Iterative building**: Each step builds upon the previous step's final state in the root folder
4. **Copy for reference**: When a step is complete, we copy the relevant files to `training/{step}/` as reference implementations

**For Trainees**: When using this training:

1. **Clone and work in root**: Trainees clone the repository and work directly in the project root folder
2. **Progressive building**: Each step modifies files in the root folder, building upon the previous step's results
3. **No folder switching**: Trainees never work in the `training/{step}/` folders - those are for reference only
4. **Starting state**: The root folder is set up with the appropriate starting files for step 1

**Important**: When writing training content, avoid language like "building from the starter files in `training/2-using-mcp`" because trainees work in the root folder, not in the training subfolders.

## Content Structure for Exercise Steps

For hands-on exercise steps, follow this structure based on Bitovi Academy format:

### Required Sections (in order):

1. **Title (H1)**: Clear, descriptive title
2. **Introduction**: What the learner will understand/learn by the end (learning objectives, concepts, skills)
3. **Problem (H2)**: The specific practical challenge or task they need to solve in this exercise
4. **What you need to know (H2)**: Everything needed to accomplish the task
5. **Technical Requirements (H2)**: Explicit instructions without giving away the solution
6. **How to verify your solution (H2)**: Instructions on testing the solution
7. **Solution (H2)**: The complete, exact solution

### Content Guidelines

#### What you need to know

- Include analogous example code when helpful
- For non-MCP utility code (like slug generation), provide complete implementations
- Use H3 subsections (###) when there's a lot to cover
- Focus on concepts directly relevant to MCP development
- **Link to official documentation**: Always provide links to official documentation for any libraries, frameworks, or tools introduced
- **Include general knowledge**: How things work, conceptual understanding, background theory

#### Technical Requirements

- Be explicit but don't reveal the final solution
- Include any necessary setup steps
- Provide clear acceptance criteria
- Include file paths and specific method names when relevant

#### Code Examples

- Use TypeScript for all MCP-related code
- Include proper imports and type annotations
- Show minimal, working examples
- For utility functions unrelated to MCP learning objectives, provide complete code:

```typescript
const slug = text
  .toLowerCase()
  .normalize("NFKD")
  .replace(/[^\w\s-]/g, "")
  .trim()
  .replace(/[\s_-]+/g, "-")
  .replace(/^-+|-+$/g, "");
```

#### Solution Section

- Provide complete, working code
- Include all necessary imports and setup
- Test the solution before including it
- Add brief explanations for key concepts

## Content Structure for Conceptual Steps

For explanatory/foundational steps (like "What is MCP?"):

1. **Title (H1)**: Clear, descriptive title
2. **Introduction**: What the reader will learn
3. **Main content sections (H2)**: Organized by concept
4. **Subsections (H3)**: As needed for detailed topics

## Technical Standards

### MCP SDK Usage

- Use `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` version ^1.18.0
- Prefer official SDK patterns and examples
- Keep up with transport deprecations (HTTP+SSE ‚Üí Streamable HTTP)

### Dependencies

- Node.js 18+ required
- TypeScript for all examples
- Zod for schema validation

### Code Quality

- Include proper error handling
- Use clear variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow TypeScript best practices

## Training Flow Considerations

### Progressive Complexity

- Start with simple stdio servers
- Move to HTTP transport
- Add streaming capabilities
- Introduce validation and security
- End with production deployment

### Practical Examples

- Use realistic, useful tools (not just "hello world")
- Include common patterns developers will need
- Show both simple and complex scenarios
- Demonstrate proper error handling

### Testing and Verification

- Include MCP Inspector usage instructions
- Provide clear success criteria
- Show expected outputs
- Include common troubleshooting tips

## Writing Style

### Accuracy and Verification

- **NEVER invent URLs, API endpoints, or technical specifications**
- **ASK for clarification when technical details are uncertain**
- **Only use URLs and endpoints that are explicitly provided**
- **Verify all technical claims before including them**

### Tone

- Clear and direct
- Practical and hands-on
- Assume JavaScript/TypeScript familiarity
- Explain MCP-specific concepts thoroughly

### Formatting

- Use code blocks with language specification
- Include file paths in backticks: `src/server.ts`
- Use **bold** for important concepts
- Use > blockquotes for important notes or warnings

### Table of Contents

- When adding a table of contents, place it immediately after the introduction/learning objectives
- Do NOT create an H2 heading for "Table of Contents" - add the navigation list directly
- Use standard Markdown anchor links: `[Section Name](#section-name)`
- Include main sections (H2) and important subsections (H3) as appropriate
- Example format:

  ```markdown
  Learn about [topic] and understand [objectives].

  - [Main Section](#main-section)
    - [Subsection](#subsection)
  - [Another Section](#another-section)

  ## Main Section
  ```

### Emoji Usage

- ‚úèÔ∏è Use for actionable steps the user should take (following Bitovi Academy pattern)
  - If there is more than a single step, use single ‚úèÔ∏è followed by descriptive text and numbered list
    - Example: "‚úèÔ∏è Perform the following to start the server:" followed by numbered steps
- üí° Use for tips and helpful insights
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Use for warnings or important cautions
- üîç Use for verification/testing steps
- üìù Use for notes or additional context

### Examples

- Prefer complete, runnable examples
- Include necessary imports and setup
- Show realistic use cases
- Test all code before including
