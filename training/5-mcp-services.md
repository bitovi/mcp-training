CP NOTES: We need to do the following (this is not a complete list):
- Explain what clients are doing when calling GET / POST / DELETE endpoints. Why all three http methods?
- Tell them to create a seperate file (and maybe script) to manage the service code. This will need to import the McpServer.
- Explain why Streamable HTTP is the new baseline. Please look up reasoning and site / link to it.
- How to verify your solution: Will need to tell them to test with both VSCode and MCP Inspector.  
- What you need to know: Will need to remind them they already know how to connect to a http service (we did it with either Jira or Github in step 2)
- Question: Why is Hono listed? Doesn't seem needed.
- Bonus Content: NGrok to test ChatGPT and remote systems
