CP NOTES: We need to do the following, this is likely not a complete list.

- Install node (>20)
- Download VSCode
- mkdir
- `npm init`
- setup typescript and a main (using something like `node --import ./loader.mjs server/server.ts`)


Folks should verify their node version.

We should give instructions for both windows and linux-based computers.


TODO: We probably want to create this as a github repository and use `dev containers` to run the project ... Then folks will need to clone the project. We will do this later.
